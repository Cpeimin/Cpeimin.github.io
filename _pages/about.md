Hi there! I am a visiting student at UC Berkeley, working with Pro. Lu Liang in the Geospatial 3M Lab. I am also a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, Sun Yat-sen University, advised by Prof. Huabing Huang. 

I mainly use remote sensing, GIS, and geospatial AI to explore the urban 3D dynamics, focusing on building height estimation, large-scale urban 3D mapping, and embodied carbon analysis of urban expansion.
